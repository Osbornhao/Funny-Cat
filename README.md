# Funny-Cat

Funny Cat is a project for collecting answers from folks of your choice. Create a question and share it with your family, friends, chatgroup or whoever you want. Everyone with the link could join the discussion! However, like every topic in the real world, people will shift their focus away after some time. The data server will delete your question **FOREVER** after 14 days. So, be sure to check the topic before it fades away.
